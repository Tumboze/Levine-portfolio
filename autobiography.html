        <h1>Autobiography of Levine Otieno Mirewe</h1>
        <p>Greetings,</p>
        
        <p>I am Levine Otieno Mirewe, a passionate and dedicated Telecommunication and Information Engineering student, eager to share my journey and experiences.</p>

        <p>Born and raised in Asembo ,Rarieda District, I embarked on my educational journey at St. Lazurus Primary School, where I laid the foundation for my academic endeavors from 2008-2015. These early years shaped my curiosity and ignited my interest in technology.</p>

        <p>My high school years at Maranda High School [2016-2019] were a pivotal time in my life. Here, I delved into the world of Telecommunication and Information Engineering, undertaking coursework that laid the groundwork for my current academic pursuit. These formative years not only enriched my academic knowledge but also fostered skills in teamwork and collaboration.</p>

        <p>Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Telecommunication and Information Engineering at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology, with an expected graduation date in 2026. This academic journey has been a remarkable chapter in my life, filled with challenges and triumphs, further fueling my passion for the field.</p>

        <p>In the realm of skills, my expertise encompasses a range of areas, including Telecommunication Systems, Network Design and Implementation, Data Communication, and proficiency in programming languages such as C and HTML. I have honed my abilities in Signal Processing, Wireless Communication, and developed strong troubleshooting and problem-solving skills. My commitment to effective communication protocols, such as TCP/IP and UDP, showcases my dedication to staying at the forefront of technological advancements.</p>

        <p>One of the highlights of my academic journey has been the collaborative effort on the IOT Project - a Vehicle Monitoring System. Working seamlessly with my peers, we successfully brought this project to fruition, demonstrating our ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.</p>

        <p>Outside the academic sphere, my hands-on experience includes internal attachment, where I worked on electrical installation and Cisco Networking. Additionally, during an external attachment, I gained valuable insights into the world of fiber optics. These experiences have enriched my practical understanding of the industry and complemented my academic pursuits.</p>

        <p>As I continue my journey in Telecommunication and Information Engineering, I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. My commitment to excellence, coupled with a strong foundation in both theoretical knowledge and practical experience, positions me as a dedicated professional ready to contribute to the dynamic field of technology.</p>

        <p>I extend my gratitude to George, my manager at Faibacom, whose reference underscores my capabilities and commitment to my chosen path. I look forward to the adventures and challenges that the future holds, confident in my ability to make meaningful contributions to the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>

        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Levine Otieno Mirewe</p>
